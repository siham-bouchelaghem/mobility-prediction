# mobility-prediction
LSTM framework for next cell prediction in 5G network

- datasets/profil{1,2}.csv: positions (generated by SUMO) for two vehicle profiles.
- datasets/positions.csv: merge of the two previous files.
- datasets/rsus.csv: positions of RSUs deployed in the simulation area.

- datasets/dataset1.csv: ordered dataset of the RSUs visited by the two profiles.
- datasets/dataset{2,7}.csv: datasets with history.

- p2r.py: script for generating these dataset{k}.csv.

USAGE: ./p2r.py -d datasets/positions.csv -r rsus.csv -k 5 > datasets/dataset5.csv

- fold.pl: script to generate dataset{k}.csv from dataset1.csv without having to redo the calculations.

USAGE: ./fold.pl 6 datasets/dataset1.csv > datasets/dataset6.csv
